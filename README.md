This repository contains code for the Tensorflow implementation of a Chat Bot from the online course "Deep Learning and NLP A-Zâ„¢: How to create a ChatBot" provided by Udemy and SuperDataScience and taught by Hadelin de Ponteves and Kirill Eremenko.

## Project Desription:
* Designed and Trained a Deep NLP model on a Seq2Seq Architecture to create a chatbot using the TensorFlow RNN(LSTM) model.
* The dataset used to train the chatbot is the Cornell Movie Corpus Dataset, which contains nearly 220,000 lines of conversation between characters from over 600 movies, this helps in creating a chatbot that can have general conversations.

## Dependencies:
1. Python ==> 3.5
2. Tensorflow ==> 1.0.0
3. numpy ==> 1.14.3
