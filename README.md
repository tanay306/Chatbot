## Project Desription:
* Designed and Trained a Deep NLP model on a Seq2Seq Architecture to create a chatbot using the TensorFlow RNN(LSTM) model.
* The dataset used to train the chatbot is the Cornell Movie Corpus Dataset, which contains nearly 220,000 lines of conversation between characters from over 600 movies, this helps in creating a chatbot that can have general conversations.

## Dependencies:
1. Python: 3.5
2. Tensorflow: 1.0.0
3. numpy: 1.14.3
